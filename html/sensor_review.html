<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111872">iPhone 13 Apple tech specs overview</a><br />
This is an overview of the iPhone 13 and all the sensors and tech specs that are included with the phone. This is coming directly from apple so all the information is credible. The only major issues is that there isn't any deeper explinations of the sensors that the phone uses. Rather it's more of a list of specs for the phone. Due to the lack of detailed information, that will knock this down a point. However this is a good reference for a quick snapshot at what the phone has for tech.<br />
